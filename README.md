## Project Setup
This Flutter project integrates with Google Sheets to read and write data. To enable Google Sheets access, you'll need a service account and credentials in JSON format. This guide will walk you through how to create a service account, configure your Google Sheets, and use the credentials in This Flutter project.


## Setup Instructions

1. Create .env File
  In the root of your Flutter project, create a .env file with the following content:
  ```
  SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id_here
  GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS='your_google_credentials_json_here'
  QR_SHEET_TITLE=qrsheet
````
2. Add the Correct Values

- SPREADSHEET_ID: Replace your_spreadsheet_id_here with the actual ID of your Google Sheet. The spreadsheet ID is the long alphanumeric string in the Google Sheets URL (e.g., https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit).

- GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS: Paste the entire JSON content of your service account credentials in the value of GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS. This is the JSON file you download from the Google Cloud Console after creating a service account.

- QR_SHEET_TITLE: Set the title of your Google Sheets worksheet where QR data is stored (default is qrsheet).

3. Run ``` flutter pub get   ``` to install all dependencies
